ChimpStudyCase-Robot
====================

This entire project is a study case for the [Chimp][2] project. Includes the Petri Net and the software that consume the Chimp component.




Enviroment and settings
===========

All the petri nets are located in the *design* folder. To see and edit them you need Tina, which is a petri net editor that can be download from [here][1]. At this moment there are three petri nets showing different models of the same problem domain. We are using just the *design/petriNets/robotsInifineLive.ndr* because this one has no deadlocks.
